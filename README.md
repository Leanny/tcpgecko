# What is this?
This is the official TCP Gecko Installer of the [JGecko U](https://github.com/BullyWiiPlaza/JGeckoU) client. You will only receive support if you use the latest versions of both.

# How do I use this?
This is an app for the [Homebrew Launcher](https://github.com/dimok789/homebrew_launcher). Make sure to read the [setup guide](https://gbatemp.net/threads/jgecko-u-setup-guide.426292/).

# Can I use TCP Gecko.NET?
No, you will run into incompatibility problems. It's not supported anymore but for what do you still need it? Submit a feature request and it might happen.

# Does this support [DiiBugger](https://github.com/Kinnay/DiiBugger)?
No. Both projects are fundamentally different.

# How do I compile?
Just like described [here](https://github.com/dimok789/homebrew_launcher/blob/master/README.md#building-the-homebrew-launcher).
